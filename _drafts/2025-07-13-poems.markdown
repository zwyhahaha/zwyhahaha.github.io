## Flowers

by Miley Cyrus

> I can buy myself flowers
>
> Write my name in the sand
>
> Talk to my self for hours
>
> Say things you don't understand
>
> I can take myself dancing
>
> And I can hold my own hand
>
> Yeah, I can love me better than you can

## Possibilities

by Wislawa Szymborska

> I prefer exceptions
>
> I prefer to leave early
>
> I prefer talking to doctors about something else
>
> I prefer the absurdity of writing poems
>
> to the absurdity of not writing poems
>
> I prefer, where love's concerned, nonspecific anniversaries
>
> that can be celebrated every day
>
> I prefer zeros on the loose
>
> to those lined up behind a cipher
>
> I prefer keeping in mind even the possibility 
>
> that existence has its own reason for being

I want to share the story behind this poem. I learned this poem from an elective class about Nobel Literature Prize winners, hosted by Prof. Dong Ding @SUFE. As the last assignment in the class, Prof. Ding let us write our own *Possibilities*, and she assembled the poems from our classmates into a new poem, Possibilities for class 2023. This poem is accessible, yet powerful especially when it echoes with a group of people from diversified backgrounds. Finally, I highly recommend SUFE students to select this course, this is one of the most rewarding courses in my undergrad years!
