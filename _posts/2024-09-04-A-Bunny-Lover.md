My little bunny hopped into my life in May 2022, and it’s been two and a half years of fluffy joy since then. Watching it grow into a plump, happy bundle of fur has been such a rewarding journey. I thought it’d be nice to share my tips and experiences, hoping to help anyone thinking of bringing a bunny into their home.

## Bunny Diet:

1. **A Common Bunny Myth** ❌: Your bunny’s favorite meal is **not** carrots and lettuce! While nursery rhymes might have taught us otherwise, those are just for getting kids to eat veggies. Bunnies actually have sensitive tummies and shouldn’t rely on high-water-content veggies as their main food.
2. **The Right Way to Feed Your Bunny**:
   * For baby bunnies, alfalfa hay is the perfect staple.
   * For adult bunnies, timothy hay is their go-to meal.
     Always provide **unlimited hay**—it keeps their teeth healthy and their little tummies moving. Don’t worry about overfeeding; bunnies naturally eat, digest, and poop in harmony.
3. **Don’t Forget Water**: Always give your bunny fresh water. A little water bottle in the cage works great, and purified water is the safest choice.
4. **Bunny Snacks and Treats**: While bunny pellets are fine in moderation, they shouldn’t replace hay as the main course. And yes, bunnies *love* sugary treats like fruit and bread, but keep these as rare surprises. (Pro tip: watch out for sneaky snack thefts!)
5. **What to Do in a Hay Emergency**:
   If you run out of hay, don’t panic! Here’s what you can do until the new batch arrives:
   * Feed them celery leaves or cilantro—safe options for a bunny in a pinch.
   * If you must, you can pick grass from a safe area and dry it well. But honestly, this should be a last resort because of pesticides and other risks.
     Emergency measures aside, always keep the hay stocked up—your bunny deserves the best!

## Beyond the Bunny Diet: Other Care Tips 

1. **The Bunny Home**:
   A sturdy and spacious cage is essential for your bunny’s comfort and safety. While free-roaming might seem ideal, I wouldn’t recommend it unless closely supervised. Bunnies are curious creatures and can easily chew through wires or sneakily munch on fruit and snacks when no one is looking!

2. **Bunny Bathroom Etiquette**:
   To keep your home clean and fresh, you’ll need a bunny toilet, some plastic liners, pee pads, and optional deodorizing spray. Training a bunny to use the toilet isn’t instant, but it’s definitely achievable since bunnies are naturally clean animals. Here’s how:

   * **Step 1**: Place the hay feeder near the bunny’s toilet. Bunnies tend to eat and poop at the same time, so this setup helps them get used to the idea of a designated bathroom.
   * **Step 2**: If your bunny relieves itself outside the toilet during playtime, clean up immediately and mask the smell with something like floral water or a disinfectant. Bunnies rely on scent to identify their bathroom spot, so any lingering smell can confuse them and turn that area into a new toilet!
   * **Step 3**: When cleaning the actual toilet, leave a little trace of the smell behind to remind the bunny it’s the right spot.

   With consistency, your bunny should master this habit within a couple of months (mine took about two). Once trained, they’ll happily stick to the cage for bathroom breaks, giving them more freedom to hop around the house!

3. **No Bunny Walks or Outdoor Adventures**:
   Taking bunnies for walks or letting them roam outside unsupervised is not a good idea. Bunnies in the wild move much faster than they do at home, and it’s almost impossible to catch them if they bolt. They’re also highly sensitive and can easily be scared to death. "Releasing" pet bunnies into the wild is a dangerous choice—it’s unlikely they’ll survive.

   A personal story: my bunny occasionally sneaks outside (we live on the ground floor). One time, it was gone for hours, hopping around the neighborhood! Thankfully, it found its way back home after a little outdoor adventure. However, the scariest time was when it went missing in the morning, and we only found it at sunset under a car, looking lost. Avoid this stress—always keep an eye on your bunny to prevent such escapades.

4. **No Baths for Bunnies!**
   Bunnies are naturally clean animals. They groom themselves thoroughly, including washing their faces, so they don’t need baths. Bathing a bunny can be dangerous, as it might scare them and lead to serious health issues. Trust your bunny’s self-care routine—they’re tidier than you think!

## A Few Final Words About Raising Bunnies

If you’re considering bringing a bunny into your life, please think carefully before making the decision.

First, make sure your family is on board. Bunny droppings can have a strong smell, and during the early stages before they’re toilet-trained, it might create some hygiene challenges that not everyone can tolerate.

Second, ask yourself if you’re ready to commit the time and energy to care for a bunny. Raising one isn’t difficult, but it does require effort to understand their habits and needs. Sadly, many tragedies happen because people aren’t willing to invest this care and attention.

If you’re ready to give your bunny the love and care it deserves, congratulations! You’re about to welcome a delightful little companion into your life. 💗 Bunnies might seem shy and aloof at first, as if they’re only interested in food. But as time goes on, you’ll notice them lying on the floor waiting for you to give them a gentle pat or even licking your clothes and hands—a sign they see you as part of their bunny family!

For example, my bunny now recognizes its name. Whenever I call out “Bunny Bunny” after coming home, it immediately turns its head toward me. Moments like these remind me of the joy and connection a bunny can bring into a home. 🐰
