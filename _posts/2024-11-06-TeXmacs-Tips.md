## About TeXmacs

[TeXmacs](https://www.texmacs.org/tmweb/home/welcome.en.html) is my favorite text editor, especially useful for those who frequently need to type mathematical formulas. I highly recommend giving it a try!

In case you need help getting started, here are some tutorials that might be useful:

Hope you enjoy using TeXmacs! :) I will keep updating this post whenever I find new tips!

## How to fix TeXmacs crash

Recently, I encountered a TeXmacs crash on my MacBook, which was quite frustrating since I couldnâ€™t use it for note-taking. :( Here is a guide to help you fix it. The crash is likely caused by a full cache, and clearing it should resolve the issue.

For macOS and Linux, run:

```bash
rm -fr ~/.TeXmacs
```

For Windows, the cache is located at `%APPDATA%\TeXmacs` and `C:\Users\[User name]\AppData\Roaming\TeXmacs`.

## TeXmacs to MarkDown

Since I occasionally write blog posts, I need a way to convert `.tm` files to `.md` files. Unfortunately, this feature is not available in the default TeXmacs installation, so you'll need to install additional plugins.

Here is a repository for the `tm2md` converter: [tm2md GitHub Repo](https://github.com/PikachuHy/texmacs-converter-tm2md)

For macOS:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.TeXmacs/progs/convert
cd ~/.TeXmacs/progs/convert
git clone git@github.com:PikachuHy/texmacs-converter-tm2md.git markdown
```

open `~/.TeXmacs/progs/my-init-texmacs.scm`, and add the following code

```scheme
(use-modules (convert markdown init-markdown))
```

For Windows, refer to the repository instructions for setup details.

## Math typing tips

- Use `option + F` to create fraction numbers.
- Type `shift + [ + Tab` to create various brackets, which is much more convenient than `\langle \rangle`.
- Select some content and type `\red` to mark it in red.
