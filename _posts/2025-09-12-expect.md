1. **Memorial Church Tour**

   Every Friday at 11:00 am, there is a docent-led tour at Memorial Church. It lasts about an hour, during which the guide thoroughly introduces the church’s history. From the mosaic paintings on the outer walls to the stained-glass windows depicting scenes from the Bible, every detail is beautiful and intricate. [Here’s the link](https://events.stanford.edu/event/stanford-memorial-church-docent-tour) to the event, it's free and open to everyone!

2. **Social Events**

   I’m not naturally a social person, but I still make an effort to join campus events. Admittedly, they can often be frustrating—especially when you get “ruled out” of a conversation (bad event). But sometimes you meet someone warm, genuine, or who shares your interests (good event).  

   Let’s do a simple math: 

   - For a bad event, the utility is $\epsilon \geq 0$. The reason is: even if it’s embarrassing, you’ll likely never see those people again, so it doesn’t really matter. Plus, you survived an awkward situation and became braver, hence the small positive $\epsilon$.  
   - For a good event, the utility ranges from $[1, +\infty)$. The baseline 1 represents the utility of doing regular lab work, and the infinity is reserved for those rare encounters where you meet someone who truly changes your path.  

   On expected utility, there’s really no reason *not* to attend social events.

   

3. **Bell’s Bookstore**

   I recently discovered this bookstore in Palo Alto. It’s open daily and offers everything from fiction to mathematics, from beautiful editions of *Pride and Prejudice* to vintage treasures. The prices are reasonable - you can get Neruda’s *Love Poems* for about the cost of a lunch. Sometimes, classical music plays softly in the background. The only drawback is the limited seating, so finding a cozy spot can be a matter of luck!
