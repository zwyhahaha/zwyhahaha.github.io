I’ve been quite busy with PhD interviews recently, and I’ve found the experience to be very rewarding. I see interviews as a great opportunity to engage in meaningful conversations with experts. During the Q&A sessions, I often ask research-related questions that I’m truly passionate about—some specific, others more philosophical. One question I frequently ask is:

<div align="center">   What is good research? </div>

While the way this question is phrased may vary, the underlying issue remains the same. Below are some of the responses I’ve encountered, based on my personal recollections, so they may not fully reflect the professors' original views.

------

First, a professor from the business school shared her perspective: when evaluating a paper, she typically looks at two key dimensions: first, whether the paper introduces **innovations in methodology or mathematics**, and second, whether it has a **broader audience**.

I also had a conversation with a renowned expert in optimization, who offered his view: the ideal research is **simple** and **natural**. However, he noted that such research is rare and, unfortunately, it’s hard to pinpoint exactly how to achieve that simplicity.

Lastly, in a discussion with another professor from the business school, he highlighted a particularly meaningful type of research: the kind that challenges widely accepted beliefs. For instance, when everyone believes conclusion A is true, your research demonstrates that this accepted view is actually biased.

Coincidentally, today I attended a lecture by [Prof. Christopher Ryan](https://christopher-thomas-ryan.github.io/), who discussed his book [*Paths to Research*](https://christopher-thomas-ryan.github.io/papers/Paths_to_Research.pdf). One chapter of the book addresses *Research Aesthetics*, and it outlines six possible perspectives on what constitutes good research. These perspectives closely align with the views I’ve shared above, so I’d like to present them here:

1. **Novelty**: Introducing new problems or new methodologies.
2. **Usefulness**: Providing solutions to real-world problems.
3. **Difficulty**: Demonstrating mathematical or intellectual brilliance.
4. **Generality**: Addressing research problems that have broad relevance across various fields.
5. **Surprise**: Something that challenges conventional wisdom (economists especially love this).
6. **Simple, yet profound**: The beauty of research lies in its simplicity and depth.

Different people emphasize these dimensions differently. Personally, I prefer simplicity and generality, as they allow us to uncover the shared, fundamental nature of seemingly different things. Prof. Ryan mentioned in his talk that great research can encompass all six of these dimensions. The key is to tailor your presentation to the preferences of your audience. For example, for those who appreciate complexity (dimension 3), you might showcase your elegant proofs, while for others who value surprise (dimension 5), you might share compelling stories. The ideas presented in his book are insightful and inspiring, so I highly recommend giving it a read!
