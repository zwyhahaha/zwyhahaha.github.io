I recently took a three-day trip to Jeju Island with my friends—a much-needed escape from our busy routines.

On the first day, the sky was overcast, and the ocean looked dark and moody. But the second day brought us perfect weather on Udo Island, where we were lucky enough to see the famous “jelly-like” turquoise sea. We also went on a speedboat ride, which was as thrilling as it sounds!

March is the off-season, making it the perfect time to visit Jeju with fewer crowds and pleasant weather. Overall, it was an unforgettable trip. And now… back to work!
