I’ve benefited greatly from reading advice posts—especially during my graduate school application process. In this post, I’ve collected some of the most helpful resources I’ve come across, covering both graduate school applications and research life. I will continue to update this list as I discover new and insightful advice.

As a gentle disclaimer, I’ll borrow a word of caution from *Carl Sandburg*:

> "Beware of advice, even this."
