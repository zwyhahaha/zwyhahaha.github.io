Previously, I used Overleaf to write `.tex` files. Itâ€™s convenient, beginner-friendly, and great for collaboration. However, it only works online, which means you canâ€™t draft your paper on a flight (maybe it's a good thing). Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™ve started transitioning to writing and compiling `.tex` files locally on macOS.

This post is a collection of helpful resources for setting up a local LaTeX environment.

## Introductory LaTeX resources

There are some excellent beginner-friendly Chinese docs:

- [A quick guide on LaTeX syntax from OI-wiki](https://oi-wiki.org/tools/latex/)
- [A more approachable blog from Liam Huang](https://liam.page/2014/09/08/latex-introduction/)

(Here I'd like to recommend [Liam Huang's blog on LaTeX](https://liam.page/categories/LaTeX/), where you can find almost everything you need to know!)

More comprehensive official documentation in English:

- [LaTeX2e: An unofficial reference manual](https://tug.org/texinfohtml/latex2e.html)
- [Learn LaTeX tutorial (available in many languages)](https://www.learnlatex.org/)

## Getting started

To set up a local LaTeX environment similar to Overleaf, youâ€™ll need:

* **TeX distribution**: This is the core engine and format bundle. On macOS, people usually use **MacTeX** (a TeX Live distribution for Mac).
* **Editor**: You can use the default TeXShop editor or other text/code editors like VS Code or Sublime Text.

Letâ€™s go through the installation step-by-step.

## Install TeX Live (MacTex)

Be prepared â€” downloading MacTeX can take a few hours, so itâ€™s often better to use mirror sites.

- TeX Live (Windows): [Official](https://tug.org/texlive/windows.html)
- MacTeX (Macs): [Official](https://tug.org/mactex/mactex-download.html) , [SJTU mirrors](https://mirrors.sjtug.sjtu.edu.cn/ctan/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX.pkg)

Reference: [Installation guide in Chinese by Liam Huang](https://liam.page/texlive/)

## Install editors

For a quick start, you can launch **TeXShop**, which comes with MacTeX. Youâ€™ll see a simple blank window â€” this is your editor. Insert a LaTeX template, click compile, and the resulting PDF appears in a separate window. Clean and elegant, right?

If this default setup works for you, great! Youâ€™re all set.
 However, if you want more features or flexibility, you can try other editors like **VS Code** or **Sublime Text**.

### VS Code configuration

You can follow [this tutorial](https://latex.lierhua.top/docs/Configuration-of-VS-Code-Mac-Version/) to configure VS Code. However, I encountered a couple of issues during setup. Hereâ€™s how I resolved them:

1. `chktex could not be found` warning

Solution: Disable the linter by adding this to your `settings.json`:

```json
"latex.linter.enabled": false
```

2. `Error: spawn pdflatex ENOENT`

This indicates the LaTeX binary isnâ€™t found. Add the correct environment path to your `settings.json` (specific to macOS):

```json
"latex-workshop.latex.tools": [
  {
    "name": "pdflatex",
    "command": "pdflatex",
    "args": [
      "-synctex=1",
      "-interaction=nonstopmode",
      "-file-line-error",
      "%DOC%"
    ],
    // Start: newly added
    "env": {
      "PATH": "/Library/TeX/texbin:/usr/local/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:${env:PATH}"
    }
    // End: newly added
  }
],

```

ðŸ”§ Make sure to set the environment path for **each tool** (e.g., `pdflatex`, `xelatex`, `latexmk`) under `latex-workshop.latex.tools`.

With all problems settled down, the compiler should work smoothly. The result looks quite polished:

### Sublime Text configuration

I hadn't used Sublime Text before writing this post, but it seems to be a powerful and customizable editor. I'm looking forward to exploring it further.

Helpful guides I used:

- [Sublime Text installation and introduction (Chinese)](https://liam.page/2013/11/11/Sublime-elegant/)
- [Sublime Text + LaTex for Windows (Chinese)](https://liam.page/2013/11/13/Sublime-with-LaTeX/)
- [Sublime Text + LaTex for Windows (EN/CH)](https://latex.lierhua.top/docs/Setting-up-Sublime-Text-Windows-version/)
- [Sublime Text + LaTex for Macs (EN/CH)](https://latex.lierhua.top/docs/Settings-for-Sublime-Text-Mac-Version/)

After following the instructions, your setup will look like this:
