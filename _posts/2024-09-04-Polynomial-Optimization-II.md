This note is taken from the [summer course](https://sites.google.com/site/cedricjosz/home/introduction-to-polynomial-optimization), in which Prof.CÃ©dric Josz makes everything clear and intuitive! This blog is about the multivariate polynomial optimization, including both unconstrained and constrained cases.
