This blog is a collection of excerpts that have stayed with me—lines from poems, lyrics, and books. I’m not an expert in literature, but I write these notes to capture and share the personal connections I feel with these beautiful words.

## Flowers

Lyrics by *Miley Cyrus*

> I can buy myself flowers
>
> Write my name in the sand
>
> Talk to my self for hours
>
> Say things you don't understand
>
> I can take myself dancing
>
> And I can hold my own hand
>
> Yeah, I can love me better than you can

## Possibilities

Poem by *Wislawa Szymborska*

> I prefer exceptions
>
> I prefer to leave early
>
> I prefer talking to doctors about something else
>
> I prefer the absurdity of writing poems
>
> to the absurdity of not writing poems
>
> I prefer, where love's concerned, nonspecific anniversaries
>
> that can be celebrated every day
>
> I prefer zeros on the loose
>
> to those lined up behind a cipher
>
> I prefer keeping in mind even the possibility 
>
> that existence has its own reason for being

I first encountered this poem in an elective course on Nobel Prize in Literature, taught by Prof. Dong Ding at SUFE. For our final assignment, she asked each of us to write our own *Possibilities*. Later, she compiled our poems into a collective version, *Possibilities for Class 2023*.

This poem is both accessible and powerful, especially when it resonates within a diverse group of people. I still think back to that class as one of the most rewarding experiences in my undergraduate years. If you’re a SUFE student, I highly recommend taking it.

## A Room of One's Own

Book by *Virginia Woolf*

This book explores the relationship between women and fiction. It is often regarded as a cornerstone of feminist writing. As Woolf herself admits:

> At any rate, when a subject is highly controversial—and any question about sex is that—one cannot hope to tell the truth. 

The book doesn’t try to provide final answers, but I found that many of Woolf’s ideas resonate with my own reflections on gender and research.

As a woman in academia, I often enter rooms filled mostly with male researchers. It is hard not to wonder why this imbalance exists, and easy to slip into the mindset of “fighting for women in academia.” But my personal belief is that research itself has no gender. To carry the weight of “sexual awareness” into research can risk distorting its purity. Woolf articulated this with clarity:

> The very first sentence that I would write here, I said, crossing over to the writing-table and taking up the page headed Women and Fiction, is that it is fatal for anyone who writes to think of their sex. It is fatal to be a man or woman pure and simple; one must be woman-manly or man-womanly.

> Some collaboration has to take place in the mind between the woman and the man before the art of creation can be accomplished. Some marriage of opposites has to be consummated. The whole of the mind must lie wide open if we are to get the sense that the writer is communicating his experience with perfect fullness.

## Zen Mind, Beginner's Mind

Book by *Shunryu Suzuki*

> If your mind is empty, it is always ready for anything; it is open to everything. In the beginner's mind there are many possibilities; in the expert's mind there are few.
>
> In the beginner's mind there is no thought, "I have attained something." All self-centered thoughts limit our vast mind. When we have no thought of achievement, no thought of self, we are true beginners.

The idea of keeping a beginner's mind is similar to "stay hungry, stay foolish". At any time, we are refreshed as a beginner, without thought of past achievements, without desire or fear for the future. I think good books are telling a common truth. You can also find "the beginner's mind" in *The Power of Now*, *Siddhartha*, and yoga practice, although they may have different names. As a beginner, you listen carefully without trying to comparing with what you have known; you keep doing things without attachment to some goals.

> When you do something, you should burn yourself completely, as a good bonfire, leaving no trace of yourself.
