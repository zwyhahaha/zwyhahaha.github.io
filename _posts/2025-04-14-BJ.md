## About visa interview

I’m traveling to Beijing for my U.S. F1 visa interview.

**Good news first:** my visa was approved within *60 seconds* of the interview starting—super smooth!

I wanted to share a quick tip (that worked well for me) for the visa interview. I learned it from a former visa officer (VO) during a webinar hosted by Northwestern University: be **proactive** in sharing your background information.

According to the VO, the first question—and your response—is the most important because it sets the tone for the entire interview. While the specific question might vary, it's usually some form of “Tell me about yourself.” In your answer, it’s a good idea to include key details like your school, its location, your major, and how you’re being funded.

You don’t need to wait for the VO to ask each of these questions one by one—remember, they’ve done this thousands of times and prefer not to drag the process out. It’s your job to clearly and confidently provide any positive context, such as fellowships or scholarships. When you’re proactive and genuine, you’re not only helping yourself—you’re also making the VO’s job easier.

Here’s how my conversation went:

------

**VO:** (after checking the previous visa application) Your passport, please.

**Me:** (while handing over my passport) I’m applying for an F1 visa to pursue a Ph.D. at [school name].

**VO:** I need your I-20. (Looks at it for a moment) Your major is Industrial Management?
**Me:** Yes! The program is Management Science and Engineering, and I’ve been awarded a fellowship.
**VO:** A fellowship. Are you a master’s student, or are you going straight into the Ph.D.?
**Me:** I’m currently an undergraduate student—going directly into the Ph.D.
**VO:** Your visa has been approved! Have a nice day!

## A random trip

During my two-day stay in Beijing, I took a random trip—no plans, just going with the flow, guided only by my mood and the weather.

On the first day, it was cloudy and windy, so I headed to Tiantan Park. On the second day, the sun came out, and my visa was approved, so I went to Shicha Sea (什刹海, a scenic area of inland lakes surrounded by old temples) to enjoy in the sunshine.

I loved every place I dropped by randomly in Beijing. Tiantan is where ancient emperors used to pray for a good harvest each year. The architecture is breathtaking—harmonious circular structures that feel both grand and peaceful. Shicha Park used to be the residential area for the royal family and government officials. Walking through the Hutongs and touching the old trees, you feel like you’re sharing the same space as the people who lived centuries ago.

I’ve placed my travel photos at the end of the post—now it’s your turn to take a break and simply enjoy the scenery!
