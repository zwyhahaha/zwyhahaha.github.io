### Welcome!

Iâ€™m Wanyu Zhang, a senior undergraduate student at <u>[Shanghai University of Finance and Economics](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/)</u>. Since the summer of 2023, I have had the privilege of conducting research under the guidance of <u>[Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/)</u> and <u>[Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/)</u>. Additionally, I have been fortunate to collaborate with <u>[Prof. Haihao Lu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/haihao-lu)</u> and <u>[Prof. Jiajin Li](https://gerrili1996.github.io/)</u>.

You can download my CV [<u>here</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CQCCthllm8AAIpPSYyHOyYi_ZPE-nAyn/view?usp=drive_link).

### About my research

My research interest lies in mathematical optimization. Currently, my research focuses on providing convergence guarantees for first-order methods. Below is a catalog of the related topics I have explored:

- Restarted primal-dual hybrid conjugate gradient algorithm for large-scale quadratic programming. Supervised by [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) and [Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/), featured by PhD student Yicheng Huang. <u>[[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16160)</u>
- Performance estimation problems for the primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm. Supervised by [Prof. Haihao Lu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/haihao-lu).
- Uniformed analysis for nonconvex-concave minimax optimization. Supervised by [Prof. Jiajin Li](https://gerrili1996.github.io/).

### About this blog

I started this blog inspired by Ariana Tang, whose blog is thoughtful and well worth-reading. Here, I typically log my technical write-ups and reading notes here. Occasionally, I share some practical tips and life experiences. It would be a great pleasure if you found some of my posts useful!
