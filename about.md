### Welcome!

I’m Wanyu Zhang, a senior undergraduate student at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics. Since the summer of 2023, I have had the privilege of conducting research under the guidance of [<u>Prof. Yinyu Ye</u>](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) and [<u>Prof. Huikang Liu</u>](https://huikang2019.github.io/). Additionally, I have been fortunate to work with [<u>Prof. Haihao Lu</u>](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/haihao-lu). In the fall, I will begin my Ph.D. in Operations Research at Stanford MS&E.

You can download my CV [<u>here</u>](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CQCCthllm8AAIpPSYyHOyYi_ZPE-nAyn/view?usp=drive_link).

### About my research

My research interests lie in **mathematical optimization**. I have worked on both establishing theoretical convergence guarantees and enhancing the empirical performance of optimization algorithms. Below is a catalog of the research topics I have explored:

- [Theory] Stochastic online scaled gradient method. Supervised by Wenzhi Gao.
- [Experiments] Data-driven mixed integer optimization through probabilistic multi-variable branching. [<u>[Paper]</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12352)
- [Theory] Restarted primal-dual hybrid conjugate gradient algorithm for large-scale quadratic programming. Supervised by [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) and [Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/). [<u>[Paper]</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16160)
- [Theory] Performance estimation problems for the primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm. Supervised by [Prof. Haihao Lu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/haihao-lu).

### About this blog

I typically log some technical write-ups and reading notes. Occasionally, I share some practical tips and life experiences. It would be a great pleasure if you found some of my posts useful.

**Acknowledgement**: This blog was inspired by **Ariana Tang**, whose blog is thoughtful and well worth-reading! Heartfelt thanks to my sister **Wanxin** for designing the site’s logo: a cute bunny with red eyeglasses and carrots! Gratitude also goes to my other sister **Xinyu** for illustrating the background image of this site, and to **Chuwen Zhang** for photographing the headshot! Finally, thank you to everyone who takes the time to read my posts — it means a lot!
