### Welcome!

I'm Wanyu Zhang, a senior undergraduate student at [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE)](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/).

I am fortunate to be part of SUFE's interdisciplinary sciences pilot program, designed for exceptional undergraduates with strong academic ambitions and affiliated with the [Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences (RIIS)](https://riis.sufe.edu.cn/). Since the summer of 2023, I've been conducting research in operations research under the guidance of [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) (Stanford University) and [Prof. Dongdong Ge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kwvdy78AAAAJ&hl=en) (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU). My time as an undergraduate here has been invaluable, surrounded by supportive professors and outstanding peers.

### About my research

My research interest lies in mathematical optimization and its applications in real-world practice. I will briefly recap my research experiences in chronological order. For preprints and repositories, you can also refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=Xt9MRH8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/zwyhahaha).

I started my research journey by engaging in several practice-driven projects, ranging from supply chain management to localization and bio-imaging problems. 

- Deep Reinforcement Learning for Supply Chain Management. Supervised by Prof. Chaolin Yang (SUFE), collaborated with Jiayu Xu, Ariana Tang, Qiushi Han. [[Paper]](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4624193)
- A Robust Anchor-based Method for Multi-Camera Pedestrian Localization. Supervised by [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) and [Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/) (SJTU). [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21308)
- Block stochastic Riemannian subgradient method for orientation determination problem of Cryo-EM images. Supervised by [Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/). [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14021)

Driven by the idea of explaining the success of these practically efficient algorithms, I extended my research scope to optimization theories. Currently, my research focuses on first-order methods for minimax optimization. To be specific, I investigated the convergence proofs of the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method and smoothed gradient descent ascent method.

- Restarted primal-dual hybrid conjugate gradient algorithm for large-scale quadratic programming. Supervised by [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) and [Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/) (SJTU), featured by PhD student Yicheng Huang. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16160)
- Performance estimation problems of PDHG. Supervised by [Prof. Haihao Lu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/haihao-lu) (MIT).
- Uniformed analysis for nonconvex-concave minimax optimization. Collaborated with [Prof. Jiajin Li](https://gerrili1996.github.io/) (University of British Columbia). 

I am currently seeking research opportunities in online learning and optimization. If you have similar ideas and find my research background aligns well with them, feel free to email me.

### About my blog

I typically log my technical write-ups and reading notes here. Occasionally, I share some practical tips and life experiences. I hope this blog will be a gateway to getting to know me and my research. It would be a great pleasure if you found some of my posts useful!
