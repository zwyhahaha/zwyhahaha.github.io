### Welcome!

I'm Wanyu Zhang, a senior undergraduate student at [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE)](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/). This website serves as a gateway to know me and my research, feel free to explore it!

I'm fortunate to enter the itnerdiciplinary sciences pilot class in SUFE, a program designed for excellent undergraduate students with academic pursuits, hosted by [Research Institute for Interdisplinary Sciences (RIIS)]( https://riis.sufe.edu.cn/). I start my research in operation research and its applications in management at 2023 summer, under the supervision of [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) (Stanford University) and [Prof. Dongdong Ge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kwvdy78AAAAJ&hl=en) (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU).  I spent wonderful undergraduate years here, working with supportive professors and outstanding peers, among whom I've learnt so much.

### About My Research

I'm fascinated by both the theories and practices of optimization algorithms, with particular interests in large-scale optimization and first-order methods (FOM). Here are some research topics I've engaged in about FOM:

- [Theory] Restarted primal-dual hybrid conjugate gradient algorithm for large-scale quadratic programming. Supervised by Prof. Yinyu Ye and [Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/) (SJTU), featured by PhD student Yicheng Huang.
- [Theory] Performance estimation problems of FOM for linear programming. Supervised by [Prof. Haihao Lu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/haihao-lu) (MIT).
- [Practice] Block stochastic Riemannian subgradient method for orientation determination problem of Cryo-EM images. Supervised by [Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/) (SJTU).

Besides, I aspire to solve real-world industrial problems, by leveraging experiences in academic fields. I interned as algorithm engineer in [Cardinal Operations](https://www.shanshu.ai/), a Chinese cooperation providing intelligent decision-making services for organizational growth. Two collaboration projects with another Chinese company, [CUE Group](https://cue.group/cn/digital-marketing.html), featured my internship

- [Vision-based Localization] Anchor-based multi-camera pedestrian localization method. Mentored by Prof. Yinyu Ye.
- [Image Generation] Aligning diffusion models for multi-character image generation. Mentored by Yitian Chen @ Cardinal Operations.

Lastly, I'm interested in solving management problems arising from supply chain, and resource allocation, by integrating modern deep learning tools, and online learning methodology.

-  [Supply Chain] Multi-agent deep reinforcement learning for joint replenishment and transshipment decisions. Hosted by Prof. Chaolin Yang (SUFE).
- [Resource Allocation] Online resource allocation under horizon ucertainty and online pricing competitions. Supervised by Prof. Simai He (SJTU).
