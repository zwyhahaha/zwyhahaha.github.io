### Welcome!

I am currently a first-year PhD student at Stanford MS&E. Previously, I obtained my bachelor's degree at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics in 2025.

My research interest lies in **optimization**. Below are the research topics I have explored:

- Stochastic online scaled gradient method.
- First-order methods for large-scale quadratic programming.
- Performance estimation problems.

### About this blog

I share ideas and stories that I find interesting, beautiful, or helpful. Many of them grow out of my own life—my research, travels, daily routines, and moments of reflection. My hope is that you’ll discover something here that resonates with you or proves useful in some way.

I’m deeply grateful to the people who helped bring this blog to life. This blog was inspired by Ariana Tang, whose blog is thoughtful and well worth-reading! Thanks my sisters for designing the site’s logo and background image, and Chuwen for photographing the headshot. Finally, thank you to everyone who takes the time to read my posts — it means a lot!
