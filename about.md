### Welcome!

I'm Wanyu Zhang, a senior undergraduate student at [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE)](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/).

I am fortunate to be part of SUFE's interdisciplinary sciences pilot program, designed for exceptional undergraduates with strong academic ambitions, and hosted by the [Research Institute for Interdisciplinary Sciences (RIIS)](https://riis.sufe.edu.cn/). Since the summer of 2023, I've been conducting research in operations research and its applications in management under the guidance of [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) (Stanford University) and [Prof. Dongdong Ge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kwvdy78AAAAJ&hl=en) (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU). My time as an undergraduate here has been invaluable, surrounded by supportive professors and talented peers from whom I've learned immensely.

### About My Research

I'm deeply interested in the theories and applications of optimization algorithms, with a particular focus on large-scale optimization and first-order methods (FOM). Below are some FOM research topics I've explored:

- [Theory] Restarted primal-dual hybrid conjugate gradient algorithm for large-scale quadratic programming. Supervised by Prof. Yinyu Ye and [Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/) (SJTU), featured by PhD student Yicheng Huang.
- [Theory] Performance estimation problems of FOM for linear programming. Supervised by [Prof. Haihao Lu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/haihao-lu) (MIT).
- [Practice] Block stochastic Riemannian subgradient method for orientation determination problem of Cryo-EM images. Supervised by [Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/) (SJTU).

Additionally, I am eager to apply academic insights to real-world industrial challenges. I collaborated on two key projects with [CUE Group](https://cue.group/cn/digital-marketing.html):

- [Vision-based Localization] Anchor-based multi-camera pedestrian localization method. Mentored by Prof. Yinyu Ye.
- [Image Generation] Aligning diffusion models for multi-character image generation.
