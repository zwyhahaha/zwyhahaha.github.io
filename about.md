### Welcome!

I am a first-year PhD student at Stanford MS&E. I obtained my bachelor's degree at Shanghai University of Finance and Economics, where I was fortunate to work with Prof. Yinyu Ye and Prof. Huikang Liu.

My research interests lie in **optimization**. Below is a catalog of the research topics I have explored:

- Stochastic online scaled gradient method. Supervised by Wenzhi Gao.
- Restarted primal-dual hybrid conjugate gradient algorithm for large-scale quadratic programming. Supervised by Prof. Yinyu Ye and Prof. Huikang Liu. [<u>[Paper]</u>](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16160)
- Performance estimation problems for the primal-dual hybrid gradient algorithm. Supervised by Prof. Haihao Lu.

### About this blog

I typically log some technical write-ups and reading notes. Occasionally, I share some practical tips and life experiences. It would be a great pleasure if you found some of my posts useful.

**Acknowledgement**: This blog was inspired by **Ariana Tang**, whose blog is thoughtful and well worth-reading! Thanks my sister **Wanxin** for designing the site’s logo, my other sister **Xinyu** for illustrating the background image of this site, and **Chuwen Zhang** for photographing the headshot. Finally, thank you to everyone who takes the time to read my posts — it means a lot!
