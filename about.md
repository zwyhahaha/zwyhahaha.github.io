### Welcome!

I'm Wanyu Zhang, a senior undergraduate student at [Shanghai University of Finance and Economics (SUFE)](https://english.sufe.edu.cn/).

I am fortunate to be part of SUFE's interdisciplinary sciences pilot program. Since the summer of 2023, I've been conducting research in operations research under the guidance of [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) (Stanford University) and [Prof. Dongdong Ge](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Kwvdy78AAAAJ&hl=en) (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, SJTU). My time as an undergraduate here has been invaluable, surrounded by supportive professors and outstanding peers.

### About my research

My research interest lies in mathematical optimization. I will briefly recap my research experiences in chronological order. For preprints and repositories, you can also refer to my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com.hk/citations?user=Xt9MRH8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN) and [GitHub Profile](https://github.com/zwyhahaha).

Currently, my research focuses on first-order methods for minimax optimization. To be specific, I investigated the convergence proofs of the primal-dual hybrid gradient (PDHG) method and smoothed gradient descent ascent method.

- Restarted primal-dual hybrid conjugate gradient algorithm for large-scale quadratic programming. Supervised by [Prof. Yinyu Ye](https://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/) and [Prof. Huikang Liu](https://huikang2019.github.io/) (SJTU), featured by PhD student Yicheng Huang. [[Paper]](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.16160)
- Performance estimation problems of PDHG. Supervised by [Prof. Haihao Lu](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/haihao-lu) (MIT).
- Uniformed analysis for nonconvex-concave minimax optimization. Collaborated with [Prof. Jiajin Li](https://gerrili1996.github.io/) (University of British Columbia).
